**Lite touch Installation of OpenShift Platform using Ansible playbook**

### **Installer Machine Prerequisite:**

RHEL 8.9 Installer machine the following configurations.

1.  At least 500 GB disk space (especially in the \"/\" partition), 4 CPU cores and 16GB RAM.

2.  Rhel 8.9 Installer machine should be subscribed with valid **Redhat credentials**.

3.  Sync time with NTP server.

4.  SSH Key pair should be there on the installer machine, if not kindly generate a new SSH key pair using the below command.

         ssh-keygen

5.  Use the following commands to create and activate a Python3 virtual environment for deploying this solution.

		'python3 -m venv \<virtual_environment_name\>  Example:virtual_environment_name=ocp
		 source \<virtual_environment_name\>/bin/activate'

6.  Execute the following commands in the Ansible Engine to download the repositories.

	    'mkdir /opt
		 cd /opt
		 yum install -y git
		 git clone <https://github.com/HewlettPackard/hpe-solutions-openshift.git>'

7.  Setup the installer machine to configure the nginx, development tools and other python packages required for LTI installation. Navigate to the directory,  /opt/hpe-solutions-openshift/DL-LTI-Openshift/ and run the below command.

         'sh setup.sh'

8.  As part of setup.sh script it will create nginx service, so user must download and copy Rhel DVD ISO to **/usr/share/nginx/html/**

9.  Minimum Storage requirement for management servers

       | **Management Servers** | **Host OS disk** | **Storage Pool disk** |
       |------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
       | Server 1               | 2 x 1.6 TB       | 2 x 1.6 TB            |
       | Server 2               | 2 x 1.6 TB       | 2 x 1.6 TB            |
       | Server 3               | 2 x 1.6 TB       | 2 x 1.6 TB            |
	
       Host OS disk – raid1 for redundancy

10.  **Creating and deleting logical drives**

    Create and delete logical drives on the head nodes following below steps.

	**Input File Update:-**

		1. User has to update the input.yaml file in /opt/hpe-solutions-openshift/DL-LTI-Openshift/create_delete_logicaldrives directory to  execute the logical drive script.
		2. User needs to update all the details in the input.yaml file which include:-
							
				' ILOServers:
					- ILOIP: 172.28.*.*
						ILOuser: admin
						ILOPassword: Password
						controller: 12  
						RAID: Raid1
						PhysicalDrives: 1I:1:1,1I:1:2  

					- ILOIP: 172.28.*.*
						ILOuser: admin
						ILOPassword: Password
						controller: 1
						RAID: Raid1
						PhysicalDrives: 1I:3:1,1I:3:2

					- ILOIP: 172.28.*.*
						ILOuser: admin
						ILOPassword: Password
						controller: 11
						RAID: Raid1
						PhysicalDrives: 1I:3:1,1I:3:2   '

	**Note:-**

		1. To find controller id login to the respective ILO -> System Information -> Storage tab where inside Location find the **slot number** as the controller id. 

					' # Example - Slot = 12 '

		2. To find the PhysicalDrives login to the respective ILO -> System Information -> Storage tab inside Unconfigured Drives where under Location you can deduce PhysicalDrives based on these information:
				
				' # Slot: 12:Port=1I:Box=1:Bay=1
				  # Example - 1I:1:1 ('Port:Box:Bay')

				  # Slot: 12:Port=1I:Box=1:Bay=2
				  # Example - 1I:1:2 ('Port:Box:Bay') '
								
   **Playbook Execution:-**
   To delete all the existing logical drives in the server in case if any and to create new logical drives named 'RHEL Boot Volume' in respective ILO servers run the site.yml playbook inside create_delete_logicaldrives directory with the below mentioned command                   

					' # ansible-playbook site.yml --ask-vault-pass'

### *Note* If you do not have proxy or VLAN based setup leave these variables empty as shown below
	servers:
	  Host_VlanID:                          
	  corporate_proxy:                        
	  corporate_proxy_port:
	  
	squid_proxy_IP: 
	corporate_proxy: 
	squid_port:

### **Input files**

We can provide the input variables in any one of the below methods

Method 1.  **Input.py : Automation way of taking input**

Through the input.py, go to the directory $BASE_DIR(/opt/hpe-solutions-openshift/DL-LTI-Openshift/) and run the below command.

            'python input.py'

Here it will prompt for values for the fields enter one by one.
A sample input collection through input.py is as follows.

			'Enter server serial number for the first head node server ( Example: 2M2210020X )
			2M205107TH
			Enter ILO address for the first head node server ( Example: 192.28.201.5 )
			172.28.201.13
			Enter ILO username for the first head node server ( Example: admin )
			admin
			Enter ILO password for the first head node server ( Example: Password )
			Password
			Enter Host FQDN for the first head node server ( Example: kvm1.xyz.local )
			headnode1.isv.local
			etc ...............................'

After execution of the command input.py it will generate input.yaml and hosts file in the same location.


Method 2.  **Input.yaml: Manually editing input file**

Go to the directory $BASE_DIR(**/opt/hpe-solutions-openshift/DL-LTI-Openshift/**), here we will have input.yaml and hosts files.

1. A preconfigured Ansible vault file (input.yaml) is provided as a part of this solution, which consists of sensitive information to support the host and virtual machine deployment.

```
cd $BASE_DIR
```

Run the following commands on the installer VM to edit the vault to match the installation environment.

```
ansible-vault edit input.yaml
```
**NOTE**
The default password for the Ansible vault file is **changeme**

Sample input_sample.yml can be found in the $BASE_DIR along with description of each input variable.

A sample input.yaml file is as follows with a few filled parameters.

				 '- Server_serial_number: 2M20510XXX
					ILO_Address: 172.28.*.*
					ILO_Username: admin
					ILO_Password: *****
					Hostname: headnode1.XX.XX                #ex. headnode1.isv.local
					Host_Username: root
					Host_Password: ******
					HWADDR1: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX             #mac address for server physical interface1 
					HWADDR2: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX             #mac address for server physical interface2 
					Host_OS_disk: sda
					Host_VlanID: 230                         #solution VLAN ID ex. 230
					Host_IP: 172.28.*.*
					Host_Netmask: 255.*.*.*
					Host_Prefix: XX                          #ex. 8,24,32
					Host_Gateway: 172.28.*.*
					Host_DNS: 172.28.*.*
					Host_Domain: XX.XX                       #ex. isv.local
					corporate_proxy: 172.28.*.*              #provide corporate proxy, ex. proxy.houston.company.net
					corporate_proxy_port: XX                 #corporate proxy port no, ex. 8080

					config:
					HTTP_server_base_url: http://172.28.*.*/  #Installer IP address
					HTTP_file_path: /usr/share/nginx/html/    
					OS_type: rhel
					OS_image_name: rhel-8.9-x86_64-dvd.iso
					base_kickstart_filepath: /opt/hpe-solutions-openshift/DL-LTI-Openshift/playbooks/roles/rhel8_os_deployment/tasks/ks_rhel8.cfg'

2. The installation user should review hosts file (located on the installer VM at $BASE_DIR/hosts) and ensure that the information within the file accurately reflects the information in their environment.

Use an editor such as vi or nano to edit the inventory file.

```
vi $BASE_DIR/hosts

```

			   '[kvm_nodes]
				172.28.*.*
				172.28.*.*
				172.28.*.*

				[ansible_host]
				172.28.*.*

				[rhel8_installerVM]
				172.28.*.*

				[binddns_masters]
				172.28.*.*

				[binddns_slaves]
				172.28.*.*
				172.28.*.*

				[masters_info]
				master1 ip=172.28.*.* hostname=headnode1

				[slaves_info]
				slave1 ip=172.28.*.* hostname=headnode2
				slave2 ip=172.28.*.* hostname=headnode3'

### **Playbook execution**

Once the playbooks executed successfully then need to deploy OpenShift cluster as follows.

**Deploying OpenShift Cluster**

Once the Bootstrap and master nodes are deployed with the RHCOS perform the following.

1. Login to the Installer VM (that we created as a part of rhel8_installerVM.yml -- it would have created one KVM VM on one of the head nodes)

2. Add the kubeconfig path in the environment variables as follows

         '$ export KUBECONFIG=/opt/hpe-solutions-openshift/DL-LTI-Openshift/playbooks/roles/generate_ignition_files/ignitions/auth/kubeconfig'

3.Now execute the following command.

         '$ openshift-install wait-for bootstrap-complete --dir=/opt/hpe-solutions-openshift/DL-LTI-Openshift/playbooks/roles/generate_ignition_files/ignitions --log-level debug'

4.Execute the below command to complete the RedHat OpenShift Cluster
installation.

         '$ openshift-install wait-for install-complete --dir=/opt/hpe-solutions-openshift/DL-LTI-Openshift/playbooks/roles/generate_ignition_files/ignitions --log-level=debug'

5.  After completion of install-complte check cluster status

         '$ oc get nodes'

### **Adding RHEL8.9 Worker Nodes**

This section covers the steps to add RHEL 8.9 worker nodes to an existing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

1. Login to the Installer VM (that we created as a part of rhel8_installerVM.yml -- it would have created one KVM VM on one of the head nodes)

2. Navigate to the directory $BASE_DIR/RHEL_BareMetalworker_nodes/

```
cd $BASE_DIR/RHEL_BareMetalworker_nodes/
```
**NOTE**

3. Use below command to edit ansible-vault protected input.yaml and enter the values as per your setup.

```
ansible-vault edit input.yaml
```

The installation user should review hosts file (located on the installer VM at $BASE_DIR/inventory/hosts)

```
vi inventory/hosts
```
4. Copy Rhel8.9 DVD ISO to /usr/share/nginx/html/ 

5. Navigate to the directory, /opt/hpe-solutions-openshift/DL-LTI-Openshift/RHEL_BareMetalworker_nodes/ and run the below command.

         'sh setup.sh' 

6. Execute the following command to add the worker nodes to the cluster

         'ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts site.yml --ask-vault-pass'

In case if user want to deploy through individual playbooks. Sequence of playbooks to be followed are:

         '- import_playbook: playbooks/rhel8_os_deployment.yml
          - import_playbook: playbooks/copy_ssh.yml

          - import_playbook: openshift-ansible/playbooks/scaleup.yml'

### **Playbook description**

**openshift-ansible/playbooks/scaleup.yml**

-   This playbook contains the script to add worker nodes to OCP cluster.This playbook queries the master, generates and distributes new certificates for the new hosts, and then runs the configuration playbooks on only the new hosts

Once all playbooks executed successfully check the node status as below.

         '$ oc get nodes'

Execute the following command to set the parameter **mastersSchedulable** parameter as **false**, so that master nodes will not be used to schedule pods.

         '$ oc edit scheduler'

### ***Note*** 
To add more RHEL worker Nodes, need to update worker details in haproxy and binddns on head nodes. Then go ahead with Adding RHEL8.9 Worker Nodes section.

**Adding RH CoreOS Worker Nodes to Existing Openshift Cluster**

This section covers the steps to add Baremetal RHCOS worker nodes to an existing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

1. Login to the Rhel 8.9 Installer VM (that we created as a part of rhel8_installerVM.yml -- it would have been created as one KVM VM on one of the head nodes)

2. Navigate to the directory $BASE_DIR(**/opt/hpe-solutions-openshift/DL-LTI-Openshift/**) then copy **input file and hosts** file to $BASE_DIR/coreos_BareMetalworker_nodes/ and later get the input file from the $BASE_DIR for ocp worker details.

**NOTE**
ansible vault password is **changeme**

3. Execute the following command to add the worker nodes to the cluster

           'ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml --ask-vault-pass'
