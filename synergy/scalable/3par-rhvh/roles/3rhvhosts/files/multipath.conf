# VDSM REVISION 1.7
# VDSM PRIVATE

# This file is managed by vdsm.

# The recommended way to add configuration for your storage is to add a
# drop-in configuration file in "/etc/multipath/conf.d/<mydevice>.conf".
# Settings in drop-in configuration files override settings in this
# file.
#
# If you want to modify this file, you must make it private so vdsm will
# never modify it. To make the file private, set the second line of this
# file to "# VDSM PRIVATE".

    # Ensures fast detection of path failures.
    #
    # Interval between two path checks in seconds. If polling interval
    # is longer, it will take more time to discover that a path failed
    # or was reinstated.

    polling_interval            5

    # Ensures fast fail when no path is available.
    #
    # The number of retries until disable queueing, or fail for
    # immediate failure (no queueing).
    #
    # oVirt is not designed to handle unlimited queuing used by many
    # devices (no_path_retry queue) or big number of retries
    # (no_path_retry 60).  These settings cause commands run by vdsm
    # (e.g. lvm) to get stuck for a long time, causing timeouts in
    # various flows, and may cause a host to become non-responsive.
    #
    # We use a small number of retries to protect from short outage.
    # Assuming the default polling_interval (5 seconds), this gives
    # extra 20 seconds grace time before failing the I/O.

    no_path_retry               4

    # Required for having same device names on all hosts.
    # DO NOT CHANGE!

    user_friendly_names         no

    # Helps propagating I/O errors to processes when the last path
    # failed.  Not necessary when using "no_path_retry fail".

    flush_on_last_del           yes

    # Ensures fast failover between paths.
    #
    # the  number  of seconds the scsi layer will wait after a problem
    # has been detected before failing IO to devices.
    #
    # With iSCSI, multipath uses this value to change the iSCSI session
    # timeout, which is 120 seconds by default.
    #
    # With FC, multipath sets the sysfs fast_io_fail_tmo value for the
    # remote ports associated with the path devices.  Multipath sets
    # this value whenever a device is reloaded (e.g. when a new path is
    # added or removed). This will override any change made in
    # /sys/class/fc_remote_ports/rport-*/fast_io_fail_tmo.
    #
    # This setting is not applicable to SAS devices.

    fast_io_fail_tmo            5

    # The number of seconds the scsi layer will wait after a problem has
    # been detected before removing a device from the system.
    #
    # For FC this is setting the sysfs dev_loss_tmo value for
    # the remote ports associated with the path devices.
    #
    # For SAS devices it is setting the I_T_nexus_loss_timeout value.
    #
    # There is no equivalent settable parameter for iSCSI devices so
    # this parameter is only applicable to FC and SAS devices.
    #
    # Usage:
    #
    # - Set this if you want failed devices to be removed from the system.
    # - Do not set this is you want failed devices to stay around, since
    #   after they are removed, they need to be rediscovered to get them
    #   back.
    # - Do not set this if the root file system is multipathed. In this
    #   case you want to set dev_loss_tmo to "infinity".  If you don't,
    #   then if all the path devices for your root file system disappear,
    #   udev will not be able to run to send the event to multipath to
    #   bring the device back.

    dev_loss_tmo                infinity

    # Supports large number of paths.
    #
    # The maximum number of file descriptors that can be opened by
    # multipath and multipathd. Should be set to the maximum number of
    # paths plus 32.
