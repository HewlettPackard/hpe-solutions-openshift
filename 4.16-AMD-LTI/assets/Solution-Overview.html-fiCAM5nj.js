It can be configured with different compute and storage building blocks to provide a mix of compute instances and storage volume characteristics. A single HPE ProLiant DL325 server gateway in rack 1 supports multiple racks.</p><p>This solution is deployed on a hybrid configuration. The RHOCP Control Plane nodes are deployed as KVM virtual machines running Red Hat CoreOS. These VMs are provisioned on three (3) HPE ProLiant DL325 Gen11 servers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.4 and KVM. RHOCP worker nodes running RHEL 9.4/RHOCP are deployed on the bare metal three (3) HPE ProLiant DL325 Gen11 servers. The temporary bootstrap node is deployed on one of the worker nodes and later configured as a worker node. The solution uses the internal storage on the HPE ProLiant DL325 Gen11 servers for both the Operating System and RHOCP applications. The environment infra support components (Installer machine, iPXE, DNS, DHCP, etc.) and a load balancer in this solution are deployed on virtual machines. The OpenShift-installer tool is run to generate ignition files that contain information about the hosts that will be provisioned. The Red Hat Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) for the nodes is then booted with the help of iPXE and the ignition files are passed with the OS image during installation. HPE ProLiant DL385 Gen11 servers leverage HPE Alletra MP (Non-switched) via iSCSI to provide persistent container volume for application workload within RHOCP.</p><h2 id="solution-architecture" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#solution-architecture"><span><strong>SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE</strong></span></a></h2><p>This chapter includes the high-level architecture and rack architecture for the NGS solution for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.</p><h3 id="component-architecture" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#component-architecture"><span><strong>Component architecture</strong></span></a></h3><p><img src="'+i+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>FIGURE 2.</strong> NGS solution for RHOCP 4.16 â€“ High-level architecture</p><p>The high-level architecture of the NGS-optimized solution for RHOCP includes the following components:</p><ul><li><strong>Head Nodes:</strong> It includes three (3) Red Hat Control Plane VMs running RHEL 9.4 and one installer machine running RHEL 9.4.
